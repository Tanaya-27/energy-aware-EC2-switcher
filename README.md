##  Reinforcement Learning Model for Energy-Aware Real-Time EC2 Instance Switching

The growing environmental cost of cloud computing demands smarter solutions for dynamic resource allocation. This system proposes EARTIS (an Energy-Aware Real-Time Instance Switcher), and leverages reinforcement learning to perform automatic EC2 instance switching based on real-time metrics like CPU and network usage. The architecture combines these metrics, decision-making, and switching layers, and uses a PPO-based agent trained in a simulated environment to minimize energy consumption and balance cost. Results show the systemâ€™s potential to reduce carbon footprint with minimal overhead. Thus, the solution provides a scalable and intelligent alternative to manual or static instance allocation.
